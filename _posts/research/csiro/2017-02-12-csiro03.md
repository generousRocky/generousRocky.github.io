### How to get started Contiki with a CC2650 board in Linux


this description assumes you’ll follow all steps by **“root”** and you are using **ubunutu 14.04**

At first, download or clone the example source codes and tools from the github project(https://github.com/csiro-wsn/contiki-examples) or my github repository (**<https://github.com/RockyLim92/radioTomography/tree/master/contiki-examples>**). I recommend to use mine because there are a few syntax errors in “tools/tools_intall.sh” in csiro github.

First of all, install git and i386 libraries. The followings are the install script.

	sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libx11-6:i386 libasound2:i386 libatk1.0-0:i386 libcairo2:i386 libcups2:i386 libdbus-glib-1-2:i386 libgconf-2-4:i386 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0:i386 libgtk-3-0:i386 libice6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libsm6:i386 liborbit2:i386 libudev1:i386 libusb-0.1-4:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libxt6:i386 libxtst6:i386 libgnomeui-0:i386 libusb-1.0-0-dev:i386 libcanberra-gtk-module:i386 gtk2-engines-murrine:i386 unzip

Second, install tool chain by running “tools/tools_intall.sh” shell script file. After then, you can compile some example codes or your own contiki code for CC2650. The following is compile command.

	make TARGET=srf06-cc26xx BOARD=sensortag/cc2650


To grogram your .elf file to CC2650 board, use Uniflash(**<http://www.ti.com/tool/uniflash>**). If you get the error message about “libgcrypt.so.11” during the installation, install libgcrypt11_1.5.3.-5 library

After install Uniflash, update Uniflash by “Help”
Go to “/opt/ti/uniflash_3.4/ccs_base/common/uscif/xds110/” and connect your device into your Linux.
Type

	./xdsdfu –m

and wait a little and type again

	./xdsdfu –f firmware.bin –r

This is kind of initializing command at the first time
